# DDAC - Architecture

Languages: [中文](02-架构设计.md) | English

---

## Four-Layer Model (Outline)
1. Specification Layer (standards, templates, guides)
2. Collaboration Layer (routebooks, reports, workflows)
3. Storage Layer (Markdown, YAML Front Matter, links)
4. Automation Layer (optional scripts, CI)

---

## Directory Structure (Overview)
Refer to project README for the tree; docs and templates are public, `.internal` is private.

---

## Note on Metrics and Privacy
- Any metrics/examples in public docs must use placeholders and reference [Methodology](./methodology.en.md).
- Do not include real personal/organization names or private paths; use neutral placeholders instead.
