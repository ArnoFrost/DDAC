# DDAC - Getting Started

Languages: [中文](03-实施指南.md) | English

---

## 5-Minute Quickstart
1. Clone repository
2. Open in Obsidian (or any Markdown tool)
3. Explore `templates/`
4. Read docs starting from [Core Concepts](01-Core-Concepts.en.md)

---

## Recommended Workflow (LWP)
- Minimal structure + clear intent + short iterations
- Use Micro-Routebook templates to produce small deliverables in 15-30 minutes

---

## Note on Metrics and Privacy
- Any metrics/examples in public docs must use placeholders and reference [Methodology](./methodology.en.md).
- Do not include real personal/organization names or private paths; use neutral placeholders instead.
